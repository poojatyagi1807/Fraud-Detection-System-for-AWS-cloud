# Fraud-Detection-System-for-AWS-cloud

We have developed a robust, versatile, parallelizable, low bias Anomaly-Based Intrusion detection System that can work with high dimensional network data to predict Zero-day intrusion with an accuracy level of 90%. An optimized Random Forest classification technique deployed in this system makes it immune to outliers and non-uniform units of measurement that are used across different network data parameters.  ​

​

This approach is a shift in Intrusion detection from commercially available Signature-Based Intrusion Detection systems to an Anomaly based detection by making use of Packet based characteristics.

It is a comprehensive poster to detail the need for such a system and the methodology we have used in developing the system

It is the source code that implements various ML models to identify an generalized, non-overfitted model that can predict a malicious attack with 90% accuracy.
